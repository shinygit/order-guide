# Order Guide

This project is to simplify following a build-to order guide.

Users are able to login view required inventory orders for the current week.

## Getting Started

To use simply go to order-guide.herokuapp.com and make an account. Your account will be prepopulated with some example items. This app is in Alpha at best and almost certainly the account will not exist soon so mess around and feel free to share ideas but don't use in production.
